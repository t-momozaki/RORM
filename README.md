# Robust Ordinal Response Model via Divergence Approach

This repository provides the R code implementing the robust inference for the ordinal response model via the divergence approach, as proposed by the following paper.

Momozaki, T. and Nakagawa, T. (2022). Robustness against outliers in ordinal response model via divergence approach. https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11965

The repository includes the following files.
- robustORM.R: The script implementing the proposed inference methods for the ordinal response model with the density-power and $\gamma$-divergences
- links.R: The script containing functions that compose several density and distribution functions
